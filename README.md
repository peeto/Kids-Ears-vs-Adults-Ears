# Kids-Ears-vs-Adults-Ears
An implementation of some science I've been testing throughout my life

I've read on the Internet about kids using high frequencies as ring tones on their phones so their parents can't hear their phones ring. Before I was a teen I hear could up to around 24kHz and now I can't even hear 18kHz. So for all your fun I've created a 22.05kHz tone for just that purpose. If you want to know why I chose that particular frequency or how it could backfire you'll have to read on. I've also added some other sounds out of inspiration. Here's the list:

1. built/ear-kids-vs-adults.wav
2. built/the-brown-sound.wav
3. built/just-aweful.wav
4. built/annoying.mp4
    
Descriptions:

1. The sound that was the inspiration for the project

2. Inspired by South Park

3. I was scouring the Internet for the worst frequency imaginable and couldn't find an exact number but this seems to be popular. I made it end in 37 just to be horrible.

4. This is a video of just a sound I made. it was inspired by being on hold to the Australian government and being subjected to hold music. I had the idea of creating background music to play back to them when they eventually answer the phone.

So when the "industry" was inventing the "Compact Disc" they didn't want the consumers to be able to get their hands on production quality music. Industry specifications are to record and produce at 96kHz or 48kHz. So the story goes that it was settled that "Compact Disc Audio" was delivered at 44.1khz so consumers would have a hard time upscaling it to 48kHz. Of course this instantly backfired and they found they now had an extremely difficult process for altering their production grade audio to 44.1kHz for consumers. They learned their lesson and when "DVD Audio" was created it allowed for music at 96kHz and we all own a lot of those discs right?

I won't go into the science of "beat frequencies" and how learning it gave me the ability to tune musical instruments but the TLDR; version is if a frequency isn't harmonic it will create other frequencies. So by creating such a high pitched frequency, it needs to be harmonic with "Compact Disc Audio" or you'll hear other things as well.

I settled on 22.05kHz because it's exactly half the maximum frequency of a CD and just inside the range of what a healthy child can hear.

Also for the adults, if you find kids using this against you then you could make a 90 minute version of it, and play it on your Hi-Fi on repeat at a loud volume, you won't hear it, but they sure will.
